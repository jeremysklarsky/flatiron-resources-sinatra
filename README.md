#Flatiron Web Immersive Resources Catalog
This is a Sinatra powered web app to help Flatiron Students keep track of useful resources, shortcuts, and gems they come across during the course of the semester.

Students can add new resources and tag the entry by subject (ruby, sinatra, SQL, etc..) and type of tool it is (gem, useful link, shortcut, etc).

Give karma to people by upvoting resources you have enjoyed!
